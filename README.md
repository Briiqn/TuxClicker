# TuxClicker is a state of the art shitcode python/bash autoclicker which targets the linux extremest open source community

This clicker is different from tranditional clickers as the sliders are weird, also there is little customizability but soon i'll add configs and themes.

This clicker bypasses the servers below

hypixel.net  <30 cps

cavepvp.org  <18 cps

ghostly.live <20 cps

minemen.club <16 cps

any servers running karhu <16 cps

ncp, matrix, aac, <23 cps

If you want to modify the clicker in anyway you MUST link this repo and make it OPEN SOURCE.

If you dont comply with the GPL license I most likely won't take action but don't run to me if your stuff get's leaked and u get clowned on
