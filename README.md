# TuxClicker is a state of the art shitcode python/bash autoclicker which targets the linux extremest open source community

# This clicker is different from tranditional clickers as the sliders are weird, also there is little customizability but soon i'll add configs and themes.

# This clicker bypasses the servers below

hypixel.net  <30 cps

cavepvp.org  <18 cps

ghostly.live <20 cps

minemen.club <16 cps

any servers running karhu <16 cps

ncp, matrix, aac, <23 cps

Run it via the terminal lol

# How Do I run the Clicker

After the dependencies are installed download a image and rename it to oldwallppr.webp and put it into your ~/Pictures folder

Then run the clicker and it should display that image you just downloaded

Now run Lunar Client and the clicker should open
_________________________________
# HoW Do I Ss ByPaSs???
copy and rename the python/python3 executable in /usr/bin/

rename the autoclicker file

use something like kde connect to run it off of a different device that can be disconnected without a trace.

The clicker by default tries to hide the fact it exists
